Social Network Analysis with Signal/Collect
========================================================================================================================

Signal/Collect is a framework for computations on large graphs. The model allows to concisely express many iterated and data-flow algorithms, while the framework parallelizes and distributes the computation.

This repository contains an implementation of standard social network analysis metrics such as PageRank or Betweenness Centrality and calculations of graph properties like density, reciprocity or diameter using the pre-release snapshots of the distributed 2.1 version of Signal/Collect.

How to Compile the Project and develop in Eclipse
